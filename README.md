# Citronetto - A general purpose and study bot
Citronetto is a Discord bot whose main features place the user's wellbeing at the very centre. We believe that quality should be privileged over quantity and in that spirit the bot's features put an equal emphasis on social activities as on producitivty. Created for Lemonsalt's community on Discord, the bot will be made publicly available after the alpha release.

[**Invite Citronetto here** (coming soon)]("here"), and get started with `/help`.

## üí≠ Philosophy
------------
We strive for balance between hard cramming work evenings and social life during the pandemic. Lately 
I have a study community myself called [The Study Lions](http://discord.gg/studylions "The Study Lions"). 

The community members decided to raise funds and hire an amazing developer that created our own unique study/productivity bot. 

As soon as we published the bot, hundreds of new students made their first step and started using our virtual study rooms as well!

Over the months we got many suggestions so we kept updating and adding more and more features to the bot!

I decided to invest further and make the bot public and open-source, so more study servers will be able to enjoy it as well, this way we can connect all study servers and create a network of students.
